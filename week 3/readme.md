# Week 3. Apr. 5: Sampling, Bias, and Causal Inference with Deep Learning

Below you have links to a Colab version of the notebook, where you are encouraged to do your homework. Once you open the file on Colab, make a copy of it to your own drive. Then, rename the colab notebook such that you remove "student_copy" in the beginning of the file name to your CNET id. This is the file which you will be submitting as your HW.

While it is not necessary for you to fork this repository or download the static notebooks present here, it is advised to do so so that you have a local copy as well. You can also view the static notebooks on nbviewer if you are just browsing content.

In Week 3, you turn in **two** notebooks. Submit Notebook 1 (required). Along with that, you can choose to submit either Notebook 2 or Notebook 3.

* Google Colab Notebooks:

Notebook 1: Sampling (Required)
